# weather-react
A React app for the weather

This app is an exploratory project in learning React.  It uses React, Webpack, GoogleMaps Geolocation API,
Dark Sky Weather API, and Firebase Hosting.

A working live preview can be found [here](https://the-weather-30e94.firebaseapp.com).

It also represents a vast improvement on a [former project](https://github.com/mattgaskey/weather), which 
was essentially a spaghetti code, jQuery-heavy beginner's JS project.
